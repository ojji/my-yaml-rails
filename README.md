# YAML CSS Framework

YAML (*Yet Another Multicolumn Layout*) is a modular CSS framework for truly flexible, accessible and responsive websites. YAML is focussed on device independent screen design and provides bullet-proof modules for flexible layouts. This is a perfect starting point and the key to truly responsive design.

=============

## Installation

Simply put this into your Gemfile:
`gem 'yaml-rails', :git => 'https://github.com/ojji/my-yaml-rails.git'`

and run `bundle install`.

You can then configure your application easily by running
`rails generate yaml:install`

Be careful though since it will create a new application layout file, if you want to keep your already existing code you should rename it before.
